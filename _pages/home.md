  Machine Learning Tutorials.<br />
---

I am currently creating tutorials on topics related to Machine Learning.

I have started with Object Detection. I will be creating more tutorials if there is considerable response to this course.

## 1. Evolution of Object Detection Networks
I have covered some of the important papers in this field like Dalal & Triggs Detector which uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Deformable Parts Model (DPM), Overfeat, Selective Search, Edge Boxes, Bag of Visual Words (BoW), Spatial Pyramid Pooling Network (SPPNet), RCNN, FAST RCNN, Faster RCNN. Tutorials on all these topics are already done and you can find them [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/evodn/intro). If time permits, I might also cover RFCN, SSD, YOLO.

## Further Plans
My next target is to cover a. Segmentation, b. Action Recognition etc.
I am also interested in covering Audio (havent decided the topic yet, there are many to choose from: Speech Recognition, Speaker Recognition, Music Generation, Noise Cancelling). But as I said, only if there is considerable support to this line of teaching.
