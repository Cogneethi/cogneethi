Hi, I am Nikhil. I am a Machine Learning engineer. I have previously worked on Embedded systems and Android.

I am mainly interested in Computer Vision part of Machine Learning.
I have worked on the following:
* Face Detection/Recognition using FaceNet and ArcFace.
* Human Body Pose Estimation using open-pose.
* Synthetic Face Generation using GANs (StyleGAN2 and a custom GAN).
* Speaker Recognition/Diarization.
* Speech to Text, Keyphrase Extraction and Sentence Similarity using NLP techniques.
* Machine Learning for 3D data.

I have worked on Images, Audio and Text. I can switch domains and get a deeper understanding of a topic and start working on it.
I am currently looking for freelance/full-time/remote jobs.
