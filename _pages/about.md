Hi, I am Nikhil. I am a Machine Learning engineer. I have previously worked on Embedded systems and Android.

I am making tutorial videos on topics related to ML. As of now I have started with Object Detection.

If there is considerable [support](/donate) for this kind of tutorials, I will continue making more on the same lines.
